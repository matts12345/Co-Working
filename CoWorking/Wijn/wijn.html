                    The more I tasted this wine, the more I felt it leaves a lot to be desired. The wine has developed an herbaceous tea, smoky, and cherry-scented nose with new oak lurking in the background. The wine, which has lost its baby fat, sags a bit in the middle, and reveals a Medoc-like austerity and tannic structure atypical for a Pomerol. It is closer to medium than full body, and appears to be going through an awkward stage. Will it come around, or continue to lose fruit?
